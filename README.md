# 3D-recurrent-R-U-Net
The deep-learning-based surrogate model for dynamic flows - 3D recurrent R-U-Net
Code for training: two jupyter notebooks (train-pressure and train-saturation).
Code for testing: two jupyter notebooks (test-pressure and test-saturation).
The recurrent R-U-Net module is developed in unet_uae_filter_16_32_32_64.py.
The developed 3D convolutional LSTM module (bottom level code) is in convolutional_recurrent_3d.py.
